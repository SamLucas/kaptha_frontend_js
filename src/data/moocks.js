Aim of the study was to investigate the role of sensory nerves (SN) in the protective effect of ghrelin in acute pancreatitis (AP). Studies were performed on male Wistar rats or isolated pancreatic acinar cells. After capsaicin deactivation of sensory nerves (CDSN) or treatment with saline, rats were pretreated intraperitoneally with ghrelin or saline. In those rats, AP was induced by cerulein or pancreases were used for isolation of pancreatic acinar cells. Pancreatic acinar cells were incubated in cerulein-free or cerulein containing solution. In rats with intact SN, pretreatment with ghrelin led to a reversal of the cerulein-induced increase in pancreatic weight, plasma activity of lipase and plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). These effects were associated with an increase in plasma interleukin-4 concentration and reduction in histological signs of pancreatic damage. CDSN tended to increase the severity of AP and abolished the protective effect of ghrelin. Exposure of pancreatic acinar cells to cerulein led to increase in cellular expression of mRNA for TNF-α and cellular synthesis of this cytokine. Pretreatment with ghrelin reduced this alteration, but this effect was only observed in acinar cells obtained from rats with intact SN. Moreover, CDSN inhibited the cerulein- and ghrelin-induced increase in gene expression and synthesis of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in those cells. Ghrelin exhibits the protective effect in cerulein-induced AP on the organ and pancreatic acinar cell level. Sensory nerves ablation abolishes this effect.", "pmid": 28665321, "created_at": "2020-10-31T22:33:52.396Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-31T22:33:52.396Z", "SVM_PROB": 0.988439, "FORESTS_PROB": 0.79333335, "LOGITBOOST_PROB": 0.99999386, "MAXENTROPY_PROB": 0.9999485, "med": 0.94542867 }, "rule": [{ "id": 306071, "sentence_id": "286653211", "association_type": "polifenol-gene", "R1": "nao", "R2": "nao", "R3": "nao", "R4": "nao", "R5": "nao", "R6": "nao", "R7": "nao", "R8": "nao", "R9": "nao", "R10": "nao", "R11": "nao", "R12": "nao", "R13": "nao", "R14": "nao", "R15": "nao", "HM12": "nao", "HM3": "nao", "HM4": "nao", "HM5": "nao", "HM6": "nao", "HM7": "nao", "HM8": "nao", "HM9": "nao", "HM10": "nao", "is_title": "sim", "has_entity": "sim", "is_association": "sim", "start_pos": "1", "end_pos": "125", "sentence": "CH& -Sensitive Sensory Nerves Are Necessary for the Protective Effect of G&N n in Cerulein-Induced Acute Pancreatitis in Rats.", "original_sentence": "NA", "pmid_article": 28665321, "created_at": "2020-10-31T22:53:37.085Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-31T22:53:37.085Z", "R16": "nao", "peso_frase": 7, "peso_genes": 0, "entitiesRules": [{ "id": 1825872, "V1": 43685, "pubtatot_term": "Ghrelin", "db_term": "ghrelin", "db_equivalence": "ghrelin", "mesh_id": "35727", "term_id": "6286", "start_pos": 78, "end_pos": 85, "entity_type": "gene_entity", "entity_pmid": 28665321, "created_at": "2020-10-31T15:24:43.494Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-31T15:24:43.494Z" }, { "id": 1673643, "V1": 320, "pubtatot_term": "Ghrelin", "db_term": "ghrelin", "db_equivalence": "ghrelin", "mesh_id": "35727", "term_id": "6286", "start_pos": 78, "end_pos": 85, "entity_type": "gene_entity", "entity_pmid": 28665321, "created_at": "2020-10-31T15:11:28.411Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-31T15:11:28.411Z" }] }] }, { "pmid": "16322288", "peso_rules": "0.14", "peso_entities": "1.0", "peso_genes": "0.0", "peso_final": 0.27, "article": { "id": 67687, "title_article": "Ghrelin and a novel preproghrelin isoform are highly expressed in prostate cancer and ghrelin activates mitogen-activated protein kinase in prostate cancer.", "abstract_article": "There is evidence that the hormone ghrelin stimulates proliferation in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line although the underlying mechanism(s) remain to be determined. A novel, exon 3-deleted preproghrelin isoform has previously been detected in breast and prostate cancer cells; however, its characterization, expression, and potential function in prostate cancer tissues are unknown. Expression of ghrelin and exon 3-deleted preproghrelin was investigated in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues by reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Proliferation and apoptosis assays were done in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line to determine if ghrelin stimulates proliferation and/or cell survival. Stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation by ghrelin was determined in PC3 and LNCaP cells by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for phosphorylated MAPKs. Prostate cancer tissues display greater immunoreactivity for ghrelin and exon 3-deleted preproghrelin than normal prostate tissues, and prostate cancer cell lines secrete mature ghrelin into conditioned medium. Treatment with ghrelin (10 nmol/L), but not the unique COOH-terminal peptide derived from exon 3-deleted preproghrelin, stimulates proliferation in the LNCaP cells (45.0 +/- 1.7% above control, P < 0.01) and rapidly activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 MAPK pathway in both PC3 and LNCaP cell lines. Ghrelin, however, does not protect prostate cancer cells from apoptosis induced by actinomycin D (1 microg/mL). The MAPK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 blocked ghrelin-induced MAPK activation, as well as proliferation, in both cell lines.

interest in the concept of epigenetic modulators and therapy. We report here the identification and characterization of the acetylation inhibitory potential of an important dietary flavonoid, luteolin. Luteolin was found to inhibit p300 acetyltransferase with competitive binding to the acetyl CoA binding site. Luteolin treatment in a xenografted tumor model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), led to a dramatic reduction in tumor growth within 4 weeks corresponding to a decrease in histone acetylation. Cells treated with luteolin exhibit cell cycle arrest and decreased cell migration. Luteolin treatment led to an alteration in gene expression and miRNA profile including up-regulation of p53 induced miR-195/215, let7C; potentially translating into a tumor suppressor function. It also led to down-regulation of oncomiRNAs such as miR-135a, thereby reflecting global changes in the microRNA network. Furthermore, a direct correlation between the inhibition of histone acetylation and gene expression was established using chromatin immunoprecipitation on promoters of differentially expressed genes. A network of dysregulated genes and miRNAs was mapped along with the gene ontology categories, and the effects of luteolin were observed to be potentially at multiple levels: at the level of gene expression, miRNA expression and miRNA processing.

the broad safety window of these compounds. However, many of these compounds are hydrophobic and poorly soluble in water. They frequently display low bioavailability, poor systemic delivery, and low efficacy. To circumvent this problem, we explored a novel approach toward chemoprevention using nanotechnology to deliver luteolin, a natural compound present in green vegetables. We formulated water-soluble polymer-encapsulated Nano-Luteolin from hydrophobic luteolin, and studied its anticancer activity against lung cancer and head and neck cancer. In vitro studies demonstrated that, like luteolin, Nano-Luteolin inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells (H292 cell line) and squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) cells (Tu212 cell line). In Tu212 cells, the IC50 value of Nano-Luteolin was 4.13 μmol/L, and that of luteolin was 6.96 μmol/L. In H292 cells, the IC50 of luteolin was 15.56 μmol/L, and Nano-Luteolin was 14.96 μmol/L. In vivo studies using a tumor xenograft mouse model demonstrated that Nano-Luteolin has a significant inhibitory effect on the tumor growth of SCCHN in comparison to luteolin. Our results suggest that nanoparticle delivery of naturally occurring dietary agents like luteolin has many advantages and may have potential application in chemoprevention in clinical settings.

for 300,000 deaths per year worldwide and overall survival rates have shown little improvement over the past three decades. Current treatment methods including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy leave patients with secondary morbidities. Thus, treatment of HNSCC may benefit from exploration of natural compounds as chemopreventive agents. With excellent safety profiles, reduced toxicities, antioxidant properties, and general acceptance for use as dietary supplements, natural compounds are viewed as a desirable area of investigation for chemoprevention. Though most of the field is early in development, numerous studies display the potential utility of natural compounds against HNSCC. These compounds face additional challenges such as low bioavailability for systemic delivery, potential toxicities when consumed in pharmacological doses, and acquired resistance. However, novel delivery vehicles and synthetic analogs have shown overcome some of these challenges. This review covers eleven promising natural compounds in the chemoprevention of HNSCC including vitamin A, curcumin, isothiocyanate, green tea, luteolin, resveratrol, genistein, lycopene, bitter melon, withaferin A, and guggulsterone. The review discusses the therapeutic potential and associated challenges of these agents in the chemopreventive efforts against HNSCC.

        "The synthesis of hydroxyflavone derivatives is described. The acyl derivatives of 3-, 6-, 7-hydroxyflavones (compounds 2, 4, 6, respectively) and chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone, 7) were obtained in high yields and evaluated in vitro for their cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines of different origin: MCF-7 (breast cancer), A549 (nonsmall cell lung cancer), MES-SA (uterine sarcoma), LoVo (colon cancer), drug-resistant human cancer cells (MES-SA/DX5, LoVo/DX) and also towards non-cancer cell line MCF-10A (normal breast epithelial cells). The flavones modified with acyl group showed higher antiproliferative activity than free hydroxyflavones. The highest activity was noted for 3-acetoxyflavone (2), which proved active against LoVo, LoVo/DX, and MES-SA cell lines (IC50 from 4.7 μM to 7.8 μM, respectively). The highest ability to overcome the barrier of resistance (resistance index=0.82) against the drug-resistant MES-SA/DX5 cells compared to the parental drug-sensitive MES-SA cell line was found for 7-acetoxyflavone (6).",

      abstract_article:
        "Irinotecan (CPT11) and Oxaliplatin have been used in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin for treating colorectal cancer. However, the efficacy of these drugs is reduced due to various side effects and drug resistance. Fisetin, a hydroxyflavone possess anti-proliferative, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity against various types of cancers. Apart from that, fisetin has been shown to induce cytotoxic effects when combined with other known chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether Fisetin was capable of sensitizing both Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin resistance colon cancer cells and explored the possible signaling pathways involved using In vitro and In vivo models. The results showed that Fisetin treatment effectively inhibited cell viability and apoptosis of CPT11-LoVo cells than Oxaliplatin (OR) and parental LoVo cancer cells. Western blot assays suggested that apoptosis was induced by fisetin administration, promoting Caspase-8, and Cytochrome-C expressions possibly by inhibiting aberrant activation of IGF1R and AKT proteins. Furthermore, fisetin inhibited tumor growth in athymic nude mouse xenograft model. Overall, our results provided a basis for Fisetin as a promising agent to treat parental as well as chemoresistance colon cancer. ",

Antiproliferative activity of 68 plant polyphenols on human liver cancer cells were screened by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. Structure-activity relationships were analyzed by comparison of their activities with selected structures. Cell cycle progression was assayed by flow cytometry analysis and apoptosis was analyzed by DNA fragment assay. Based on their backbone structures, 68 polyphenols were sub-classed to flavonoids (chalcones, flavanones, flavones and isoflavones), chromones and coumarins. The order of their potency to suppress the human liver cancer cells is chalcones > flavones > chromones > isoflavones > flavanones > coumarins. Chalcones comprise the most potent group with IC(50) values ranging from 21.69 to 197 microM. Top nine most potent chalcones in the group have hydroxylation at 2'-carbon position in B-ring. Flavones ranked second in their potencies. Quercetin, 4-hydroxyflavone and luteolin are three hydroxyflavones with highest potencies in this group. Their IC(50) values are 30.81, 39.29 and 71.17 microM, respectively. Chromones, isoflavones, flavanones and coumarins showed much lower potencies when compared to the first two groups with IC(50) ranges of 61 to >400, 131 to >400, 138 to >400 and 360.85 to >400 microM, respectively. In mechanistic studies, the most potent chalcone, 2,2'-dihydroxychalcone could induce G2/M arrest and then apoptosis of the cancer cells. An analysis of structure-activity relationship showed that following structures are required for their inhibitory potencies on human liver cancer cells: (1) of the six sub-classes of the polyphenols tested, the unique backbone structure of chalcones with a open C-ring; (2) within the chalcone group, hydroxyl substitution at 2'-carbon of B-ring; (3) hydroxyl substitution at 3'-carbon in B-ring of flavones. However, some other structures were found to decrease their potencies: e.g. substitutions by sugar moieties in flavones. These data are valuable for design and modification of new polyphenols, which could be potential antiproliferative agents of cancer cells.",

      abstract_article:
        "Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss. has been used as part of an ethnobotanical remedy against many forms of human cancer in Iran. It has been demonstrated that a flavonoid named xanthomicrol from D. kotschyi contributes to its preferential antiproliferative activity against malignant cells. In the present study, the antiproliferative activity of its flavonoid fraction was further characterized. Using liquid-liquid extraction and a semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC method, eight flavonoid aglycones were isolated from the aerial parts of the plant and their identities were confirmed through MS and NMR analyses as luteolin, naringenin, apigenin, isokaempferide, cirsimaritin, penduletin, xanthomicrol and calycopterin. The in vitro antiproliferative activity of each compound was evaluated against a panel of established normal and malignant cell lines using the MTT assay and some structure-activity relationships were observed. The hydroxyflavones (luteolin, apigenin and isokaempferide) exerted comparable antiproliferative activities against malignant and normal cells, while the methoxylated hydroxyflavones (cirsimaritin, penduletin, xanthomicrol and calycopterin) showed preferential activities against tumor cells. This activity may be of value in treating tumors as it would exert few side effects in normal tissues. Xanthomicrol selectively inhibited the growth of human gastric adenocarcinoma, while calycopterin selectively prevented human acute promyelocytic leukemia and human colon carcinoma cells proliferation.

      abstract_article:
        "Treatment of human endothelial cells with cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interferon-gamma induces the expression of specific leukocyte adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell surface. Interfering with either leukocyte adhesion or adhesion protein upregulation is an important therapeutic target as evidenced by the potent anti-inflammatory actions of neutralizing antibodies to these ligands in various animal models and in patients. In the present study we report that cotreatment of human endothelial cells with certain hydroxyflavones and flavanols blocks cytokine-induced ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin expression on human endothelial cells. One of the most potent flavones, apigenin, exhibited a dose- and time-dependent, reversible effect on adhesion protein expression as well as inhibiting adhesion protein upregulation at the transcriptional level. Apigenin also inhibited IL-1 alpha-induced prostaglandin synthesis and TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production, suggesting that the hydroxyflavones may act as general inhibitors of cytokine-induced gene expression. Although apigenin did not inhibit TNF-alpha-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B(p50(NFKB1)/p65(RelA)) we found this flavonoid did inhibit TNF-alpha induced beta-galactosidase activity in SW480 cells stably transfected with a beta-galactosidase reporter construct driven by four NF-kappa B elements, suggesting an action on NF-kappa B transcriptional activation. Adhesion of leukocytes to cytokine-treated endothelial cells was blocked in endothelial cells cotreated with apigenin. Finally, apigenin demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan induced rat paw edema and delayed type hypersensitivity in the mouse. We conclude that flavonoids offer important therapeutic potential for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases involving an increase in leukocyte adhesion and trafficking.",

      abstract_article:
        "Microtubule targeting based therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment; however, resistance and side effects remain a major limitation. Therefore, novel strategies that can overcome these limitations are urgently needed. We made a novel discovery that fisetin, a hydroxyflavone, is a microtubule stabilizing agent. Fisetin binds to tubulin and stabilizes microtubules with binding characteristics far superior than paclitaxel. Surface plasmon resonance and computational docking studies suggested that fisetin binds to β-tubulin with superior affinity compared to paclitaxel. Fisetin treatment of human prostate cancer cells resulted in robust up-regulation of microtubule associated proteins (MAP)-2 and -4. In addition, fisetin treated cells were enriched in α-tubulin acetylation, an indication of stabilization of microtubules. Fisetin significantly inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Nudc, a protein associated with microtubule motor dynein/dynactin complex that regulates microtubule dynamics, was inhibited with fisetin treatment. Further, fisetin treatment of a P-glycoprotein overexpressing multidrug-resistant cancer cell line NCI/ADR-RES inhibited the viability and colony formation. Our results offer in vitro proof-of-concept for fisetin as a microtubule targeting agent. We suggest that fisetin could be developed as an adjuvant for treatment of prostate and other cancer types.

      abstract_article:
        "Although treatment of prostate cancer has improved over the past several years, taxanes, such as cabazitaxel, remain the only form of effective chemotherapy that improves survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, the effectiveness of this class of drugs has been associated with various side effects and drug resistance. We previously reported that fisetin, a hydroxyflavone, is a microtubule-stabilizing agent and inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and suggested its use as an adjuvant for treatment of prostate and other cancer types. In this study, we investigated the effect of fisetin in combination with cabazitaxel with the objective to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit, reduce dose and toxicity, and minimize or delay the induction of drug resistance and metastasis. Our data show for the first time that a combination of fisetin (20 μmol/L) enhances cabazitaxel (5 nmol/L) and synergistically reduces 22Rν1, PC-3M-luc-6, and C4-2 cell viability and metastatic properties with minimal adverse effects on normal prostate epithelial cells. In addition, the combination of fisetin with cabazitaxel was associated with inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis. Furthermore, combination treatment resulted in the inhibition of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis when assessed in two in vivo xenograft mouse models. These results provide evidence that fisetin may have therapeutic benefit for patients with advanced prostate cancer through enhancing the efficacy of cabazitaxel under both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent conditions. This study underscores the benefit of the combination of fisetin with cabazitaxel for the treatment of advanced and resistant prostate cancer and possibly other cancer types.

      abstract_article:
        "Recently flavonoids have attracted the attention of researchers in the fight against cancer. Calycopterin and xanthomicrol, are two polymethoxylated flavonoids found in the aerial parts of Dracocephalum kotschyi Bioss.. We have recently shown that these compounds possess antiangiogenic activity and may be of value as potential anticancer agents. In order to demonstrate putative in vivo antitumor effect of these compounds we needed preliminary information on both pharmacokinetics and toxicological properties of these two agents. A new online SPE HPLC method for measurement of calycopterin and xanthomicrol in rat plasma was developed. Pharmacokinetic parameters of calycopterin and xanthomicrol, after i.v. administration in rats, were determined. The plasma half-life for both agents was around 4 h, however, the volume of distribution of calycopterin appeared to be about 8 times greater than xanthomicrol. This was probably due the greater hydrophobicity of the former which had other consequences such as much smaller maximum plasma concentration of calycopterin compared to its less methoxylated congener. Preliminary toxicological study of xanthomicrol failed to show any behavioral, histological and biochemical adverse effects after repeated administrations of high doses. Pharmacokinetics of xanthomicrol in rats.",
